						<li>Introduction</li>
							<p> Mr. Morris is a man of remarkable talent. However, like all people in life we are all blessed with some type of talent. Some express theirs in different ways, some do not even express theirs. My father's talent? He is a genius, he has the ability to adapt, and his work ethic is matched by none other. I have come to think that god blesses all, however, I like to incorporate that with the idea that in this earthly world the most adaptable people thrive the most. Why is this relevant to Mr. Morris? Let's looks at his life. </p>
						<li>Childhood</li>
							<p> It all started from an early age. From the start Mr. Morris grew up in the trash cans of life. He grew up in the lower class with not a cent to his name. He was at rock bottom. His mother was a single struggling and hardworking women.  He was the 2nd eldest child with three brothers and one sister. 
Despite the fact that he was the 2nd eldest man of the house, his god given ability allowed him to soon take lead of the house hold since his father had left. At the age of around 9, as he witnessed his father leave, he soon took his pain to God. He took refuge in a closet of his household and cried out to the lord that he, God, was the only father he needed. Some could say that this true desire for god, as his father, was not unheard. He may not have noticed god listening at the time but this could be seen as the turning point of his life. As my father progressed in life he had certainly not always been the most well behaved kid. A matter of fact he was so bad that his own mother told him that she didn't expect him to live past his 20's. 
This not being directly his own fault, but he grew up in an environment that was toxic. The hood was not a place for anything but trouble--from seeing people getting shot square in the head, to peer pressure of robbing people just for boredoms sake. 
For a young man to know anything better than what he was surrounded by was something unheard of. Everyone told Mr. Morris that he would not amount to anything. He took to boxing to relieve the pain he had in life. He participated in all kinds of sports and activities such as football and playing the trumpet. Here he excelled with much skill and talent however, the environment he was in still surrounded him. All this pressure and negative energy can play a huge role in adapting a young man. But god had a plan for Mr. Morris, god did not forget his faithful desire that he had proclaimed that day in the closest when he was at his lowest. Mr. Morris had enrolled in the Annual community lottery that would give the winners an internship in a laboratory. Out of all of the kids in the hood he and another young man were chosen. This was gods break that blessed Mr. Morris' life forever. This small lottery for an internship was the lottery of life, and he had just one.</p> 
<p> This internship allowed my father to be exposed to a very new environment allowing him to work with laboratory professionals within the middle class--this exposed him to new ways of thinking, attitudes, and a completely new culture from where he was, as stated before "the trash cans of life". 
After taking a trip to one of his bosses' houses, there he stood in amazement of the lifestyle that the man had possessed. He had only seen this kind of living on television. He soon began to realize that the life he wanted was at the edge of his fingertips. All he had to do was adapt, to grow away from the hood culture and progress towards a culture that promoted growth, and opportunity. Being surrounded by this new powerful environment--Mr. Morris began to learn how to speak with proper eloquence, his attitude towards hanging out with friends changed, he was more studious, and had more desire for something greater that god had to offer. God had called Mr. Morris and unlike most people who do not pick up, he decided that he would. 
As his internship went on Mr. Morris wanted to be known as the hardest worker. Even if that meant him being the best dish washed for the laboratory. His ambition even for such a mere level job was noticed. The boss took a liking to kens work ethic. However, as time went by he noticed something else in him and the boss came up to him and spoke to him one day telling him that he had needed to lighten up and not seem so mean and angry all the time. He said we are all good around here, there is no need to act tough and be full of pride--just relax. This talking had a mind shift on him that again crafted him into the man he is today. From where he grew up a man didn't smile, he didn't show emotions, he was supposed to be as cold as the streets demanded. After this talk with the boss, soon all of the hood culture was evaporating away from his being. He was becoming a man of greater ability and progressing.</p>
						<li>College Days</li>	
							<p>After graduating high school Mr. Morris decided to go off to college. He pursued ODU for a couple of years and then transferred to VCU. During this time he continued to still work the internship job during the summers. Now, while he was at ODU he was doing poorly and just sliding by. He asked his friends at ODU what they were doing after graduation of college and they all said they would be going to work for their father's companies. He realized that he needed to buckle down, ASAP. He didn't have a company to go back and work for. All he had waiting upon his return would be the hood, and he refused to go back there. Shortly after this realization he decided to transfer to VCU. They would allow him in to their program but it had a condition. That condition being that since his grades were so awful at ODU that he would need to get straight A's the next semester to prove that he was worthy of the acceptance. As his god given ability allowed--he accomplished this. He graduated VCU with a degree in chemistry. Shortly after doing so he moved to nova where he landed his first real full-time job. While up there he worked not only that job but two other jobs just to survive. He would take paper in the mornings, and he would work at Georgetown in the afternoons after his full time job. He would save pennies just to use that as his gas money. Trying to keep up with the expensive living of northern Virginia put him in a position where he was again reaching rock bottom. Juggling all the bills and expenses he was overwhelmed. A lady soon came up to him and told him that he needed to tithe and give to god. He initially thought the lady was crazy because he had no money to give. But he eventually gave in and made money to give to god. As soon as this happened god started opening doors for him. He soon got a new job in Richmond. He was making a lot more money and paying for a lot less living expenses. He moved into a nice apartment, then a new door opened and a paper route opened and within that year he had payed off all of his debts. The following year after that, he was finally in a position to buy his own first house. </p>
						<li>Adulthood</li>
							<p>Mr. Morris progressed in life to marry his amazing wife. Mrs. Morris. In-fact they initially met in a local church here in Virginia. He had built a family with her--giving life to 2 boys who would grow into men that would carry the torch that Mr. Morris had lit and carried so very far. With his wife, they were their kid's biggest fan in sports, school, and life. He continued to progress in his work He soon rose up in the ranks and began to lead positions of power within the federal government. He soon went back to working in northern Virginia while he would commute from his home in the Richmond area. He excelled in his work and was paid very well for it. They would send him to locations all around the world such as Germany, California, Texas, and so many other places. Later on in his career he transferred back down to Richmond to work at the main department of defense headquarters. Here he accomplished one of the greatest achievements that the department of defense has and possibly will ever reach. Mr. Morris fearlessly led his team, as the lead hygienist within the entire department of defense to a Star in safety. Now, this is important because it had never been done before. In-fact he had done this with zero less than 90 day fix notices. The audit lasted two days, which is unheard of in the safety field. These Audits usually take weeks to finish.  Again, none of these have never happened. They have always received 90 day fix notices. He accomplished the unthinkable according to the ideas of the supervisors above him. They doubted him and his team with much certainty saying that it was hopeless. They even tried to blatantly blame the unsuccessful results on Mr. Morris--as they would with a scapegoat. However, as we look back they had nothing else to say but praise for his accomplishments. As we look back at his life we see that god has never failed Mr. Morris. God has never let Mr. Morris fail in his endeavors.  He has retired before the age of 60 years, and is very active. He has accumulated a net worth of at least a million and continues to receive benefits from other sources. He has a supportive and loving family. Mr. Morris is the prime example of how a man from the trash cans of life can adapt to what god has called for him. He is a man of ability and has laid a foundation for the morris family. </p>
