	`<h2>The reason for this page</h2>
		<p>The reason for this page is chiefly established from the presence of my father, Ken Morris SR., and the coming of his birthday. 
		Chris Morris, his youngest son, was very confused in what to get his father for his 58th birthday. 
		Around the same time he was working very hard to learn how to program. 
		A week later after building the knowledge and confidence to try and tackle his first development project--he soon 
		needed to find ideas on what to create. Then out of nowhere the idea to create a website for his father's birthday came to him. 
		He knew it would be a hard and challenging task but this was something he knew would give a test to his knew found knowledge. 
		What better project to try the skills than a project with such a deep and meaningful connection. 
		This connection in turn helped motivate him to finish and add greater detail to the sites functionality so that it was the best he could offer within the given timeframe.</p>
